# Motivation
The motivation for this re-write initially was to add some more functionality to the greylist application
process. The two main desired features being email update sending and a way to greylist directly from
the website. It soon became clear that it would be easier to consolidate the entirety of our in-house
web pages in one project.

# Notable Features
- Staff may now greylist people directly from the application review page.
- Authorization to restricted pages, like application review, is handled by discours.
- Applicants may now sign up for (optional) emails regarding the status of their application.
